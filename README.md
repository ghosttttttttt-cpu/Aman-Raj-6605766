Student Performance Analysis SystemThis project is a Python-based utility designed to simulate academic performance data for a cohort of students. It generates scores across multiple subjects, calculates a Semester Performance Index (SPI), and produces visual insights into class-wide performance.📊 OverviewThe script automates the creation of a "Gradebook" for 60 students in an MBA Business Management program. It handles:Data Simulation: Uses NumPy to generate realistic, randomized scores for five core subjects.Grade Calculation: Logic to assign letter grades and SPI based on percentage thresholds.Data Export: Saves the final processed dataset to student_performance_data.csv.Visualization: Generates three key charts to analyze trends and distributions.🛠️ RequirementsTo run this script, you will need Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:Bashpip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
📂 File Structurestudent_analysis.py: The main Python script.student_performance_data.csv: The generated dataset (created after running).average_subject_scores.png: Horizontal bar chart of subject averages.spi_distribution.png: Histogram showing the density of student SPIs.grade_distribution_marketing.png: Pie chart of grades for the Digital Marketing module.📈 Grading LogicThe script follows a standard academic grading scale:Percentage RangeLetter GradeSPI Points$\ge 90\%$A+10.0$80\% - 89\%$A9.0$70\% - 79\%$B+8.0$60\% - 69\%$B7.0$50\% - 59\%$C6.0$< 50\%$F0.0🚀 How It WorksInitialization: Sets a seed (42) for reproducibility so the "random" data remains consistent across runs.Score Generation: Subjects like Financial Accounting and Microeconomics are assigned random scores with a dynamic "low bound" to simulate varying difficulty levels between exams.Grand Total: Aggregates scores from all 5 subjects plus a Continuous Training (CT) score (max 30).Visualizations:Bar Chart: Compares the difficulty of subjects by looking at the mean score.Histogram: Displays the "skewness" of the class performance.Pie Chart: Specifically breaks down the grade success rate for the Digital Marketing course.
